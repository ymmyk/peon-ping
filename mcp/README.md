# peon-ping MCP Server

MCP server for [peon-ping](https://peonping.com) — gives AI agents access to 70+ game sound packs via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## What it does

One tool: `play_sound`. The agent calls it with a sound key like `"duke_nukem/Groovy"` and it plays through your speakers.

Sound catalog exposed as MCP Resources — the client reads the catalog once, the model knows what's available, no repeated tool calls to browse.

## Setup

```bash
# Install peon-ping if you haven't
curl -fsSL https://peonping.com/install | bash

# Install MCP dependencies
cd mcp && npm install
```
