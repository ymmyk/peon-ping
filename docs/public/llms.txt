> Game character voice lines when your AI coding agent needs attention.

peon-ping plays voice lines from Warcraft, StarCraft, Portal, Zelda, and 70+ other games when your AI coding agent finishes a task, needs permission, or hits an error. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Kiro, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible AI agent.

## Install

```bash
brew install PeonPing/tap/peon-ping
```

or

```bash
curl -fsSL peonping.com/install | bash
```

## What it does

When your AI agent finishes a task, asks for permission, or hits an error, peon-ping plays a voice line from a game character. The Warcraft orc peon says "Work, work." when a task completes. GLaDOS says "Oh, it's you." when a session starts. Duke Nukem says "Son of a bitch!" when something breaks.

## MCP Server

peon-ping includes an MCP server so any AI agent can call `play_sound` directly. The agent picks the sound based on context — no hooks required, works with any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peon-ping": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/peon-ping/mcp/peon-mcp.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tools: `play_sound`
MCP resources: `peon-ping://catalog`, `peon-ping://pack/{name}`

## Hook Events Supported

- session.start — Session or workspace opens
- task.acknowledge — Agent accepted work, is processing
- task.complete — Work finished successfully
- task.error — Something failed
- input.required — Blocked, waiting for user input or approval
- resource.limit — Rate, token, or quota limit hit
- user.spam — User sending commands too fast

## IDEs Supported (hook-based)
