# Changelog

## v2.9.0 (2026-02-21)

### Added
- **MSYS2 / Git Bash platform support** — `install.sh`, `peon.sh`, and `scripts/notify.sh` now detect `MSYS_NT-*` / `MINGW*` uname strings as `"msys2"` platform. Audio plays via native players (`ffplay`, `mpv`, `play`) with PowerShell `win-play.ps1` fallback. Desktop notifications use Windows toast (standard) or Windows Forms overlay, with `cygpath -w` for path conversion.

## v2.8.0 (2026-02-20)

### Fixed
- **Cursor on Windows**: peon.ps1 now maps Cursor's camelCase event names (`sessionStart`, `stop`, etc.) to PascalCase, fixing no-sounds-on-new-chat when using Third-party skills
- **Cursor on Windows**: `install.ps1` and `uninstall.ps1` now handle Cursor's flat-array `hooks.json` format (matching `install.sh` fix from v2.7.x)
- peon.ps1 pack rotation: accept `session_override` alias in addition to `agentskill`

### Added
- Click-to-focus for IDE embedded terminals (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed) — when `TERM_PROGRAM` doesn't map to a standalone terminal, falls back to deriving the IDE's bundle ID from its PID via `lsappinfo` (macOS built-in)
- PID-based `NSRunningApplication` activation in `mac-overlay.js` as belt-and-suspenders fallback when bundle ID lookup fails

## v2.7.0 (2026-02-19)

### Added
- `path_rules` config array: glob-pattern-based CWD-to-pack assignment (layer 3 in override hierarchy)
- Click-to-focus terminal on macOS notification click — overlay style detects terminal via `TERM_PROGRAM` → bundle ID mapping (Ghostty, Warp, iTerm2, Terminal.app); standard style uses `terminal-notifier` with `-activate`
- IDE PID detection (`_mac_ide_pid()`) for Cursor/Windsurf/Zed/VS Code ancestor click-to-focus

### Changed
- `active_pack` → `default_pack` (backward-compat fallback + `peon update` migration)
- `agentskill` rotation mode → `session_override` (`agentskill` accepted as alias)
- Override hierarchy (high→low): `session_override` > local project config > `path_rules` > `pack_rotation` > `default_pack`

# Changelog

## v2.6.0 (2026-02-19)

### Added
- `suppress_subagent_complete` config option (default: `false`) — when enabled, suppresses `task.complete` sounds and notifications for sub-agent sessions spawned via Claude Code's Task tool, so only the parent session's completion sound fires

## v2.5.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- `cwd` field in `last_active` state (`.state.json`) — records the working directory of each hook invocation, enabling [peon-pet](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-pet) to display the project folder name in session dot tooltips

## v2.4.1 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- Pack rotation: `session_packs` entries in dict format (after cleanup upgrade) were not recognized by the `in pack_rotation` check, causing a new random pack to be picked on every non-SessionStart event — same session could play sounds from different characters each turn
- `SubagentStart` now exits silently after saving state — previously could play `task.acknowledge` sound on the parent session
- Task-spawned subagent sessions now inherit the parent session's voice pack via `pending_subagent_pack` state, ensuring a single conversation always uses one character

## v2.4.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- Project-local config override: place a `config.json` at `.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json` in any project to override the global config for that project only

### Fixed
- `hook-handle-use.sh`: macOS BSD sed does not support `\s`/`\S` — replaced with POSIX `[[:space:]]`/`[^[:space:]]` classes (closes #212)
- OpenCode plugin: `desktop_notifications: false` in config was ignored — AppleScript notifications now respect the setting (closes #207)
- OpenCode plugin: Linux audio backend chain now matches `peon.sh` priority order (`pw-play` → `paplay` → `aplay`) with correct per-backend volume scaling

## v2.3.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- `peon volume [0.0-1.0]` CLI command — get or set volume from the terminal
- `peon rotation [random|round-robin|agentskill]` CLI command — get or set pack rotation mode from the terminal

### Fixed
- macOS overlay (`mac-overlay.js`) is now correctly copied during install — previously only `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.swift` scripts were copied, so the visual overlay banner never appeared
- Resume sessions (`source: "resume"`) preserve the active voice pack instead of picking a new random one

### Changed
- Default pack set reduced to 5 curated WC/SC/Portal packs: `peon`, `peasant`, `sc_kerrigan`, `sc_battlecruiser`, `glados`

## v2.2.3 (2026-02-18)

### Changed
- `UserPromptSubmit` removed from default registered hooks — peon no longer fires on every user message. The `/peon-ping-use` skill hook remains registered under `UserPromptSubmit`. Re-add manually to `~/.claude/settings.json` if you want the annoyed easter egg or `task.acknowledge`.
- `task.acknowledge` default changed to `false` in `config.json` template (was `true`, which caused a sound on every message even without the hook firing explicitly)

This also mitigates the Windows console raw mode issue (#205) where spawning `powershell.exe` on every `UserPromptSubmit` corrupted Claude Code's keyboard input.

## v2.2.2 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- `peon-play` and `mac-overlay.js` now resolve correctly on Homebrew/adapter installs where `$PEON_DIR` is remapped (same root cause as the `pack-download.sh` issue fixed in v2.2.1)
- Overlay notifications fall through to standard notifications when `mac-overlay.js` is not found rather than silently failing
- `USE_SOUND_EFFECTS_DEVICE` unbound variable crash in `play_sound` when called from preview context

## v2.2.1 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- `peon packs install`, `peon packs use --install`, and `peon packs list --registry` now correctly locate `pack-download.sh` on Homebrew and adapter installs where `$PEON_DIR` is remapped away from the script directory ([#204](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/204))
- Test isolation: `PEON_TEST=1` now exported globally in test setup so all `run bash peon.sh` calls correctly skip the Homebrew path probe

## v2.2.0 (2026-02-17)

### Added
- MCP server (`mcp/`) for agent-driven sound playback via Model Context Protocol
- OpenClaw adapter documented in README and llms.txt
- `SubagentStart` and `PostToolUseFailure` now registered in installer hook list
- `task.error` and `task.acknowledge` added to "What you'll hear" README table
- `/peon-ping-use` and `/peon-ping-log` skills documented in CLAUDE.md and llms.txt

### Fixed
- MCP server: `pw-play` volume now uses correct 0.0–1.0 float scale (was 0–65536)
- MCP server: reads volume from `config.json` instead of requiring `PEON_VOLUME` env var
- `openclaw.sh`: error events now map to `PostToolUseFailure` (task.error) not `Stop`
- `peon help`: added missing `mobile on/pushover/telegram` and `relay --bind` entries
- Windows installer: `PostToolUseFailure` and `SubagentStart` now registered and handled

### Changed
- Pack count updated to 75+ across all docs
- Hero copy updated to "any AI agent" framing with MCP server mention

## v2.1.1 (2026-02-17)

### Fixed
- Background relay health check on SessionStart to avoid blocking greeting sound for SSH/devcontainer users ([#190](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/190))
- OpenCode adapter `task.complete` debounce increased to 5s to prevent repeated notifications in plan mode ([#188](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/188))

- Cursor IDE hooks registration now handles flat-array `hooks.json` format

## v2.0.0 (2026-02-16)

- Trainer CLI: `peon trainer on/off/status/log/goal/help` subcommands
- Trainer reminders piggyback on IDE hook events every ~20 minutes with orc peon voice lines
- Session-start encouragement: peon immediately greets you with a workout prompt when you start a new coding session
- 24 ElevenLabs orc voice lines across 5 categories: session_start, remind, log, complete, slacking
- Pace-based slacking detection: past noon with less than 25% progress triggers slacking voice lines
- Daily auto-reset at midnight
- Configurable goals (`peon trainer goal 200`) and per-exercise goals (`peon trainer goal pushups 100`)
- Trainer section in README with quick start guide

## v1.8.2 (2026-02-15)

### Fixed

- Remove destructive `rm -rf` that wiped all sounds before re-downloading on updates ([#164](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/164))

## v1.8.1 (2026-02-13)

### Fixed

- Local uninstall now cleans hooks from global `settings.json` ([#134](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/134))
- Background sound playback and notifications on WSL/Linux to avoid blocking the IDE ([#132](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/132))

### Added
- **Native Windows support**: PowerShell installer (`install.ps1`), hook script (`peon.ps1`), and uninstaller with two-tier audio fallback (WPF MediaPlayer + SoundPlayer) ([#105](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/105))
